The dataset in here: https://reurl.cc/lQjo4E
We provide a dataset consisting of train, val, test, and annotation. Train, val, and test are PCB images, while annotation is in XML format, recording the location of defects
We develop the data preprocessing methods and use multiple classification algorithms to predict which defect type the test image belongs to.
